In the 17th century, the discipline of probability theory got its start when a gambler asked a
mathematician friend to explain some observations about dice games.
Why did he, on average, lose a bet that at least one six would appear when rolling a die four
times? And why did he seem to win a similar bet, getting at least one double-six when rolling a
pair of dice 24 times?
Nowadays, it seems astounding that any person would roll a pair of dice 24 times in a row, and
then repeat that many times over.
Letâ€™s do that experiment programmatically instead.
Simulate each game a million times and print out the wins and losses, assuming each bet was
for $1.
- Simulate 1000000 plays of the first game: You win if you get one six in four rolls of one dice.
- Simulate 1000000 plays of the second game: You win if you get double sixes in twenty four
  rolls of two dice.
  Given a payout of $1 when a win is hit calculate the:
  * Mean
  * Variance
  * Standard deviation
    
For each game's payouts.Points will be awarded to your solution based on:
  * Whether the solution compiles and works as expected
  * How clean and refactored the solution code is
  * How would you scale your solution so that it can handle even larger simulations?
  * Whether the statistics have been extracted correctly
